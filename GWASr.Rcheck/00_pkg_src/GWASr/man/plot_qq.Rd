\description{
\emph{plot_qq} takes GWAS summary statistics p-values and creates a ggplot based QQ plot.
}
\details{
Basic functionality: \emph{plot_qq} first takes the p-values from specified data frame and then based on sorted p-values creates expectations. Subsequently the data are pruned by observed p-values in a bin-wise manner before getting plotted. This pruning is done to reduce the likelihood of crashing as usual GWAS meta-analyses have large number of datapoints (millions).
